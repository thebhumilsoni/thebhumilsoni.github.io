        Hello, I'm Bhumil. I'm a mobile app developer based in Melbourne, currently working at Mantel Group.
        <p>I love turning ideas into high-quality mobile apps that offer rich UI/UX. My primary experience lies in developing native Android apps and SDKs, catering to both startups and enterprises.</p>
        <p>I enjoy the thrill of learning new things. I am currently exploring native iOS app development. Also, I know a bit or two about web development, with my latest project being this site, built with a focus on mobile-first design.</p>
        <p>Feel free to connect with me if you have any questions, or just want to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thebhumilsoni/">Say hello</a>.</p>
