        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bhumil, a mobile app developer from Melbourne, ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º.
        <p>I love turning ideas into high-quality mobile apps that offer rich UI/UX. With expertise in native Android app and SDK development, I've worked on diverse projects for both startups and enterprises.</p>
        <p>I thrive on the thrill of learning new things and have growing proficiency in iOS and visionOS app development. Additionally, I have knowledge of web development, with my latest project being this site, built from scratch with a focus on mobile-first design.</p>
